# JavaScript Clockface
This is a very simple script. It uses a HTML/CSS backdrop, and only three parts of the DOM are movable - the **hour hand**, the **minute hand** and the **second hand**.

The JavaScript utilizes a timer function that activates every one second, or 1000 ms. There is also a counter. Once the counter reaches 60, the minute hand moves. When the minute hand reaches 60, the hour hand moves.

## Note
This doesn't work in IE. Somehow the minute hand refuses to budge.
